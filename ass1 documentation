so far, ass1.c iterates through the argv vector using a pointer and searches for the -c, -d and -o flags 
and their corresponding input arguments. The input arguments are copied into 3 strings and printed out
so you can see what they are.The flags will be later used to determine how the scanning process 
will occur while the input arguments will determine where the scanning process will occur

simpleCSVsorter.h has been included as a header file to ass1.c. The function simpleCSVsorter takes 2 
arguments: 1) input file, 2)input column. This function returns 0 on success and createsa file in the
format "<inputfile>-sorted-<inputColumn>.csv" where it will output the sorted results. Once ass1.c starts
searching through directories, it can call this function to sort all .csv files in the current directory.

scannerCSVsorter.h has been added and is now included in ass1.c. In scannerCSVsorter.h, it has the function
csvfilehandler() which takes an input file, input column to sort, and output directory path. This function 
used to be called simpleCSVsorter()

ass1.c can now call csvfilehandler to check if a file is a valid file to sort on. Ass1.c also returns an 
error if the output directoy does not exist. Currently need to finish writing code to open and read through
a directory so we can test the input directory argument.
